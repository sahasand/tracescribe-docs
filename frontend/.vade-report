Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js

## Changes Implemented:

1. **Installed @vercel/analytics package**
   - Used pnpm to install @vercel/analytics@^1.6.1
   - Updated package.json with the new dependency
   - Generated pnpm-lock.yaml for dependency locking

2. **Updated root layout for App Router**
   - Modified: src/app/layout.tsx
   - Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
   - Added <Analytics /> component inside the <body> tag, after {children}
   - This ensures analytics tracking is enabled across all pages in the application

## Files Modified:
- frontend/package.json - Added @vercel/analytics dependency
- frontend/src/app/layout.tsx - Added Analytics import and component
- frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml - Generated lock file for consistent dependency resolution

## Verification Steps Completed:
✓ Linting passed with no errors
✓ Build completed successfully
✓ All changes staged with git

## Implementation Notes:
- This is an App Router project (using src/app directory structure)
- Analytics component was placed after {children} in the body tag, following Next.js best practices
- Preserved all existing code structure, fonts configuration, and metadata
- The Analytics component will automatically track page views and web vitals when deployed to Vercel

The implementation follows the official Vercel Analytics documentation for Next.js App Router projects.
